Thanks to Mr. Hiroi.
These pages has lot of interesting things for me.

This repository includes the following executables: 
รง
You can go to the top directory and 
compile and run tests with next command:

```shell
stack test
```
and run repl with:

```shell
stack exec mscheme
stack exec mscheme2
stack exec mschemec
stack exec mschemec2
```
For usage of mschemellvm, see test/testllvm.sh. 

```shell
stack exec mschemellvm testllvm.sc
llc testllvm.ll 
gcc -o testllvm testllvm.s
./testllvm
```

There are many restrictions at now (and forever)
- only 32bit integer variable is supported
- no closure
- no macro
- no list
